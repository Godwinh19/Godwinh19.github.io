# About me

## Godwin Houdji
**Data & AI**

> *I love data, and I love turning it into intelligence.*

I’m exploring how data, language, and technology can drive real-world impact.  
I build tools that make tech genuinely useful from natural language processing for underrepresented languages to experiments measuring how digital learning shapes livelihoods.  

I practise Qi Gong, enjoy learning new things, and constantly test and build always chasing better ideas and meaningful collaborations along the way.
