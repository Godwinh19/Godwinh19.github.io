# Godwin Houdji - about me

Hey there 👋🏾

I’m a computer science engineer and currently a full-time quantitative researcher.

I'm exploring how data, language, and machine learning can drive real-world impact
from building NLP tools to designing experiments that measure change.

Here, I’m sharing my learning along the way.
